# This module explores trade-offs between different model
# architectures for the conditional and unconditional generation of
# proteins, nucleic acids and small molecules:
# - biased (fixed frames, atom orders for protein/NA residues) VS
#   unbiased (every atom/residue type treated the same) handling of
#   atom and residue features  
# - small molecule atoms as tokens VS small molecule residues as tokens

# TODO
